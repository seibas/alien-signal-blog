# 🖼️ Blog Images

Place your blog post images in this folder.

## How to Add Images to Posts

### 1. Add your image to this folder
Upload or copy your image files here (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.)

Example: `my-cool-project.jpg`

### 2. Reference the image in your post content
Use markdown-style image syntax in your post content:

```
![Description of the image](/images/my-cool-project.jpg)
```

### Examples

**Simple image:**
```
![My first project](/images/project-screenshot.png)
```

**Image with detailed description:**
```
![A beautiful alien signal visualization showing patterns in the data](/images/signal-viz.jpg)
```

### Tips

- Keep image file names simple (lowercase, no spaces)
- Use descriptive names: `database-diagram.png` instead of `img1.png`
- Optimize images before uploading (compress them to reduce file size)
- Images will automatically scale to fit the blog post width
- You can add images anywhere in your content - between paragraphs, at the beginning, or at the end

### Image Placement Examples

**At the start of a post:**
```
![Header image](/images/header.jpg)

This is my first paragraph...
```

**Between paragraphs:**
```
First paragraph about my project.

![Screenshot of the app](/images/app-screenshot.png)

Second paragraph explaining the features...
```

**Multiple images:**
```
Here's the before:

![Before](/images/before.jpg)

And here's the after:

![After](/images/after.jpg)

Much better, right?
```
