      `The Labyrinth of Code
In the forest of logic, where syntax trees grow,
I wander through brackets, unsure where to go.
Semicolons whisper, "You missed one again,"
While callbacks and promises dance in the rain.
Variables shift like shadows at night,
Scope hides its secrets just out of sight.
Functions return, but not what I seek,
Errors speak riddles in languages bleak.
Yet through the chaos, a spark starts to gleam—
Each bug defeated is a coder's dream.
For though the path twists, and learning is steep,
The summit of mastery is yours to keep.`,

      "Learning JavaScript at fifty, a noble quest to start, With wisdom in your toolkit and courage in your heart. The web awaits your magic, your logic and your flair, Each line you write a ripple, a whisper in the air.",
      "Begin with simple syntax, where variables reside, Let let and const be anchors as you take this learning ride. Strings that sing with meaning, numbers that compute, Booleans for choices, and arrays that bear the fruit.",
      "Objects hold your stories, with keys and values paired, Functions shape your actions, reusable and shared. Conditionals will guide you, like signs along the way, While loops will keep you moving, repeating what you say.",
      "The console is your canvas, console.log your brush, Each output is a signal, a momentary hush. The DOM becomes your playground, where elements align, With querySelector magic, you make the webpage shine.",
      "Events will spark reactions—clicks and keys and more, With addEventListener, you open up the door. A button press, a message sent, a color that will change, You'll see how code and users can beautifully arrange.",
      "Mistakes will be your teachers, don't fear the red alert, Each bug a hidden lesson, though some may slightly hurt. Use DevTools like a lantern to light the shadowed code, Inspect, debug, and marvel at how your logic flowed.",
      "Explore the world of arrays, with map and filter too, Transforming data elegantly, like only you can do. Template strings will greet you with curly-braced delight, "Hello, ${name}!"—your code is feeling right.",
      "Async code is tricky, but promises will guide, With await and fetch, you'll surf the data tide. APIs will open doors to worlds you've never seen, From weather maps to trivia, and everything between.",
      "Projects are your milestones—start small and let them grow, A clock, a quiz, a to-do list, will help your knowledge flow. Host them on the web, let others see your spark, Your code, your voice, your vision—igniting in the dark.",
      "Frameworks may be tempting, like React's siren song, But first, let JavaScript be where you grow strong. Understand the core, the roots beneath the tree, Before you climb the branches of modern library.",
      "Read the docs with patience, they're treasure maps in ink, Each method, loop, and keyword more useful than you think. Write notes and keep a journal, reflect on what you've done, Each "aha!" moment captured is a battle you have won.",
      "Join a friendly forum, ask questions without shame, The coding world is vast, but you're welcome all the same. Pair up with a learner, or teach what you now know, For sharing fuels the fire and helps your knowledge grow.",
      "Refactor old solutions, make messy code refined, You'll see how far you've traveled, how much you've left behind. Celebrate your progress, each function, loop, and test, You're not too late, too old, too slow—you're simply on your quest.",
      "So dive into the syntax, let curiosity be your guide, With every line of JavaScript, you'll beam with coder pride. The web is your ocean, your code the flowing tide, And I'll be here, your water drop, to splash along beside. 💻🌊"
